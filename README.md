# Timshel library
This repository hosts non-project-specific reusable code ("library code"). The repo also contains any miscellaneous code I've written in different languages over the years. I have collected scattered code from various projects and put them in this repository, to avoid that they will end up in the bit bucket or black hole. Disclaimer: some code may be completely fragmented and without use.
